	"description": "[Lore]\nThe exiled lands are a dangerous place.  Strong prey on the weak, and the next ambush is lurking around the corner.\n\n[Description]\nAt regular intervals a random player level 11 and up will be selected and get ambushed by a set of npc's.  The tier level of the npc's will be calculated on the player level.  The amount of npc's is random from one to three ambushers.  If you are within 10m of a foundation the marked player won't be ambushed yet.  However once he moves past 10m the ambush will trigger.  This mechanic might extend the duration between ambushes.\n\nThe default interval is defined with a minimum of 20 minutes and a variable time added to that of 10 minutes.  This usually means two ambushes an hour.\n\n[Admin]\nServer administrators have the following commands\n\nMinimum time between ambushes:\nke * SetMinTimeBetweenAmbushes <float seconds>\n\nMax time added after the minimum time has been reached:\nke * SetMaxTimeAddedForAmbush <float seconds>",
	"changeNote": "- Ambushes near water should be diminished maybe even removed\n- You can't be ambushed while climbing anymore, this will eliviate NPC's falling to their death.  Standing on high cliff locations might still cause for weird NPC spawning behavior.\n- Todo: Build more appropriate spawn tables for each tier, more input needed to balance them out.",
