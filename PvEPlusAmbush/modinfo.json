	"description": "[Lore]\nThe exiled lands are a dangerous place.  Strong prey on the weak, and the next ambush is lurking around the corner.\n\n[Description]\nAt regular intervals a random player level 11 and up will be selected and get ambushed by a set of npc's.  The tier level of the npc's will be calculated on the player level.  The amount of npc's is random from one to three ambushers.  If you are within 10m of a foundation the marked player won't be ambushed yet.  However once he moves past 10m the ambush will trigger.  This mechanic might extend the duration between ambushes.\n\nThe default interval is defined with a minimum of 20 minutes and a variable time added to that of 10 minutes.  This usually means two ambushes an hour.\n\n[Admin]\nServer administrators have the following commands\n\nMinimum time between ambushes:\nke * SetMinTimeBetweenAmbushes <float seconds>\n\nMax time added after the minimum time has been reached:\nke * SetMaxTimeAddedForAmbush <float seconds>",
	"changeNote": "- Doing 10 attempts to spawn the ambushers at either max 3 meters above or below the player.  If for some reason after 10 attempts no location is found, the ambushers will spawn right on top of the player (think of it as the ambushers being buried in the ground or jumping on your head from the trees, if you want to give a lore twist on it)\n- There is a possibility this will fix the water spawning (slight possibility)",
